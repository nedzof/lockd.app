# Pagination and Post Rendering Fixes

## Summary of Changes

We've made several key improvements to fix the pagination and post rendering issues in the lockd.app frontend:

### 1. PostGrid Component Improvements

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Implemented a robust mechanism to prevent duplicate posts when loading more content
  - Added a `seenPostIds` Set to track which posts have already been loaded
  - Filter out already seen posts before processing and rendering them
  - Reset the tracking set when filters change to ensure fresh content

- **Pagination Logic**: Simplified and improved the pagination logic
  - Removed complex and error-prone merging logic
  - Replaced with a cleaner approach that appends only unique new posts
  - Added proper dependency tracking in useCallback to ensure consistent behavior

### 2. VoteOptionsDisplay Component Enhancements

- **Data Consistency**: Improved handling of vote options data
  - Added normalization of vote option data to ensure consistent structure
  - Ensured each vote option has a `total_locked` property
  - Created a reusable `updateTotalLocked` function to calculate and propagate total locked amounts

- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced unnecessary re-renders
  - Memoized expensive calculations with useCallback
  - Improved dependency tracking in useEffect hooks
  - Removed unnecessary DOM manipulation and logging code

### 3. PostContent Component Refinements

- **Cleaner Rendering Logic**: Simplified the rendering decision logic
  - Extracted the vote post detection logic for better readability
  - Improved conditional rendering to be more predictable

### 4. PostComponent Improvements

- **Consistent UI**: Enhanced the post display logic
  - Used React.useMemo for expensive calculations
  - Simplified conditional rendering for vote posts
  - Removed excessive debug logging
  - Improved readability and maintainability of the component

## Technical Details

1. **Pagination Implementation**:
   - Uses cursor-based pagination with the backend
   - Tracks the next cursor for subsequent requests
   - Properly handles the "hasMore" flag to show/hide the load more button

2. **Vote Post Detection**:
   - A post is considered a vote post if:
     - It has `is_vote` set to true OR `content_type` is 'vote'
     - AND it has vote options (non-empty `vote_options` array)

3. **Data Flow**:
   - PostGrid fetches posts and handles pagination
   - PostComponent determines if a post is a vote post
   - PostContent renders either regular content or VoteOptionsDisplay
   - VoteOptionsDisplay handles vote option rendering and interactions

## Testing

The changes have been tested to ensure:
- No duplicate posts appear when loading more content
- Vote posts with options display correctly
- Vote posts without options display as regular posts
- Total locked amounts are calculated and displayed correctly
- The UI remains responsive during pagination operations

These improvements should resolve the pagination issues and provide a more consistent user experience when interacting with posts and vote options.
