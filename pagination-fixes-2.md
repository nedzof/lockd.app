# Lockd.app Pagination Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Infinite Re-render Loop in PostGrid Component**
   - Problem: The `fetchPosts` dependency array included `submissions.length`, causing the function to be recreated every time the submissions array changed, leading to an infinite loop of API calls.
   - Solution: Removed `submissions.length` from the dependency array of the `fetchPosts` useCallback hook.

2. **Unnecessary Re-renders Due to Changing Props**
   - Problem: The `userId` prop was being computed inline in the JSX, causing it to change on every render.
   - Solution: Memoized the `userId` value using `useMemo` in the Home component to ensure it only changes when `connected` or `bsvAddress` changes.

3. **Component Remounting Issues**
   - Problem: The PostGrid component was remounting unnecessarily, causing repeated API calls.
   - Solution: Wrapped the PostGrid component with `React.memo` to prevent re-renders when props haven't changed.

4. **Improved Effect Cleanup**
   - Problem: The useEffect hook for fetching posts didn't have proper cleanup, potentially causing state updates after component unmount.
   - Solution: Added a cleanup function with an `isMounted` flag to prevent state updates after component unmount.

5. **Optimized loadMore Function**
   - Problem: The `loadMore` function had `submissions.length` in its dependency array, causing unnecessary recreation.
   - Solution: Removed `submissions.length` from the dependency array to prevent unnecessary API calls.

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Proper Dependency Arrays**
   - Ensured all useCallback and useEffect hooks have the correct dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

2. **Memoization**
   - Used React.memo to prevent unnecessary component re-renders.
   - Used useMemo for computed values that should only change when specific dependencies change.

3. **Cleanup in useEffect**
   - Added proper cleanup in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks and state updates after component unmount.

4. **Improved Logging**
   - Maintained detailed logging for debugging purposes.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **State Management**
   - Consider using a state management library like Redux or React Context for global state that affects multiple components.

2. **API Request Caching**
   - Implement request caching to prevent duplicate API calls for the same data.

3. **Virtualization**
   - For large lists, consider implementing virtualization (e.g., with react-window or react-virtualized) to improve performance.

4. **Optimistic Updates**
   - Implement optimistic updates for user interactions to improve perceived performance.
