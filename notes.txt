Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix.

Keep all implementations as minimal as possible, use the KISS principle and best coding practices. Keep the files very small.
